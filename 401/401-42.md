## Enriching Your Python Classes With Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods

### What Are Dunder Methods

In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example `__init__` or `__str__`.

### examples

1. you can add a `__len__` dunder method to your class to make it return something with `len()`

2. You can implement a `__getitem__` method which allows you to use Python’s list slicing syntax: `obj[start:stop]`.

### Object Representation: __str__, __repr__

It’s common practice in Python to provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class `(a bit like API documentation.)` There are two ways to do this using dunder methods:

- `__repr__`: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of `__repr__` is to be unambiguous.

- `__str__`: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

## Python Iterators

Objects that support the `__iter__` and `__next__` dunder methods automatically work with for-in loops.
