# REACT

## JSX

### What is JSX

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It allows us to build UI elements right in the JavaScript code!

### Expressions in JSX

We can use any JavaScript expression inside JSX using curly braces.

### Attributes in JSX

React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.
For example, class becomes className in JSX.

## Virtual DOM

### How does JSX work

When the JSX expressions are compiled, they are converted into JavaScript objects, representing React elements.
React then uses these elements to build the corresponding HTML DOM and display it in the browser.

In practice, most React apps call ReactDOM.render() once.

### About Virtual DOM

React uses a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the DOM.
When an element gets changed, it is first updated in the Virtual DOM. That process is fast, as the virtual DOM is represented by simple objects.

After that, React compares the Virtual DOM to its previous state and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

## Components

Components let you split the page into independent and reusable parts.

In React, there are two types of components that you can use: Functional Components and Class Components.

### Functional Components

A functional component is a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello world.</h1>;
}
```

The code above defined a functional component called Hello, that returns a simple React element.

**Notice** that the name of the **functional component** begins with a **capital letter**. This is **absolutely** **critical**. If we start the name of a component with a lowercase letter, the browser will treat our component like a regular HTML element instead of a Component.

In order to display the component, we need to create the corresponding JSX element.

we can use our user-defined element and render it on the page:

```javascript
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello world.</h1>;
}

const el = <Hello />;
ReactDOM.render(
  el,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Class Components

Class components are typically used when there are more advanced user interactions, like forms, and animations.

All class components need to extend the React.Component class.

We can rewrite our Hello functional component as a class component:

```javascript
class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world.</h1>;
  }
}
```

Class components need to have a render method, which is in charge of telling what the page should show.

## Props

Functional components can accept arguments, similar to JavaScript functions. These arguments are called props, and represent an object.

For example, we can use props in our Hello component:

```javascript
function Hello(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
}
```

Now, we can add a name attribute to our element:

```javascript
const el = <Hello name="David" />;
```

The attribute value will be passed to the component when rendered.

### Components using Components

Components can use other components to generate an output.

For example:

```javascript
function App() {
  return <div>
    <Hello name="David" />
    <Hello name="James" />
    <Hello name="Amy" />
  </div>;
}
```

Here, our App component uses the Hello component three times, each times with a new name attribute.

### Props in Class Components

Props can be accessed in class components using this.props.

For example:

```javascript
class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Hello, {this.props.name}!</p>;
  }
}
```
