# Docker

Docker is a way to isolate and run entire applications. With Docker it doesn’t matter if you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer anymore. The entire development environment is isolated: programming language, software packages, databases, and more.

With Docker we now longer have to mess around with virtual environments. We can faithfully reproduce a production environment locally. And Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup. Wins all around.

What’s the downside? Complexity. Docker is a complex beast under the hood.

## Install Docker

- download desktop version [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- run ```$ docker --version``` to check version

## Hello, World

- run ```$ docker run hello-world``` to test function
- A good command to inspect Docker is ```$ docker info```
- use ```$ docker image ls``` to inspect just the current image
- use ```$ docker container ls -la``` to inspecting containers, either running, paused, or stopped

## Images and Containers

A baking analogy we can use here is as follows:

- A ```Dockerfile``` is the recipe for a cake
- An image is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
- A ```docker-compose.yml``` says how to make the cake
- And the container is the actual, baked cake

## Django REST Framework

Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework; it always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.

## how touse it

After use Django to build our website, we can add the REST Framework just like adding any other liberaries.

then, add it to the ```INSTALLED_APPS``` config in our ```settings.py``` file.

```python
# library_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # 3rd party
    'rest_framework', # new

    # Local
    'books.apps.BooksConfig',
]
```

Ultimately our API will expose a single endpoint that lists out all books in JSON. So we will need a new URL route, a new view, and a new serializer file (more on this shortly).

1. first create a new api app.
   ```python
   # Local
    'books.apps.BooksConfig',
    'api.apps.ApiConfig', # new
    ```
2. Adding an API endpoint is just like configuring a traditional Django app’s routes.
    1. First at the project-level we need to include the api app and configure its URL route, which will be api/.

        ```python
        # library_project/urls.py
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.urls import path, include

        urlpatterns = [
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
            path('', include('books.urls')),
            path('api/', include('api.urls')), # new
        ]
        ```

    2. Then create a ```urls.py``` file within the api app, And update it as follows:

        ```python
        # api/urls.py
        from django.urls import path

        from .views import BookAPIView

        urlpatterns = [
            path('', BookAPIView.as_view()),
        ]
        ```

    3. Next up is our ```views.py``` file which relies on Django REST Framework’s built-in generic class views.

        ```python
        # api/views.py
        from rest_framework import generics

        from books.models import Book
        from .serializers import BookSerializer


        class BookAPIView(generics.ListAPIView):
            queryset = Book.objects.all()
            serializer_class = BookSerializer
        ```

    4. A serializer translates data into a format that is easy to consume over the internet, typically JSON, and is displayed at an API endpoint.
    Make a ```serializers.py``` file within our api app then update it as follows:

        ```python
        # api/serializers.py
        from rest_framework import serializers

        from books.models import Book

        class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = Book
                fields = ('title', 'subtitle', 'author', 'isbn')
        ```
