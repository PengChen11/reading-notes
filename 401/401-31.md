# Docker

Docker is a way to isolate and run entire applications. With Docker it doesn’t matter if you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer anymore. The entire development environment is isolated: programming language, software packages, databases, and more.

With Docker we now longer have to mess around with virtual environments. We can faithfully reproduce a production environment locally. And Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup. Wins all around.

What’s the downside? Complexity. Docker is a complex beast under the hood.

## Install Docker

- download desktop version [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- run ```$ docker --version``` to check version

## Hello, World

- run ```$ docker run hello-world``` to test function
- A good command to inspect Docker is ```$ docker info```
- use ```$ docker image ls``` to inspect just the current image
- use ```$ docker container ls -la``` to inspecting containers, either running, paused, or stopped

## Images and Containers

A baking analogy we can use here is as follows:

- A ```Dockerfile``` is the recipe for a cake
- An image is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
- A ```docker-compose.yml``` says how to make the cake
- And the container is the actual, baked cake
