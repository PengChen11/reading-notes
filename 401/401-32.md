# Django Permissions

Together with authentication and throttling, permissions determine whether a request should be granted or denied access.

Permission checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed. Permission checks will typically use the authentication information in the ```request.user``` and ```request.auth``` properties to determine if the incoming request should be permitted.

Permissions are used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of the API.

The simplest style of permission would be to allow access to any authenticated user, and deny access to any unauthenticated user. This corresponds to the ```IsAuthenticated``` class in REST framework.

A slightly less strict style of permission would be to allow full access to authenticated users, but allow read-only access to unauthenticated users. This corresponds to the ```IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly``` class in REST framework.

## Object level permissions

REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

With the exception of ```DjangoObjectPermissions```, the provided permission classes in ```rest_framework.permissions``` do not implement the methods necessary to check object permissions.

## Setting the permission policy

The default permission policy may be set globally, using the ```DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES``` setting. For example.

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```

If not specified, this setting defaults to allowing unrestricted access:

```python
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
   'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',
]
```

You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views.

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```

Or, if you're using the @api_view decorator with function based views.

```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def example_view(request, format=None):
    content = {
        'status': 'request was permitted'
    }
    return Response(content)
```

Note: when you set new permission classes through class attribute or decorators you're telling the view to ignore the default list set over the settings.py file.

Provided they inherit from rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission, permissions can be composed using standard Python bitwise operators. For example, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly could be written:

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission, IsAuthenticated, SAFE_METHODS
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ReadOnly(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.method in SAFE_METHODS

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated|ReadOnly]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```

Note: it supports & (and), | (or) and ~ (not).
