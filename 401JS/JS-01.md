#  Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

## 1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?

Javascript is a greawt programing language, but it can't be run outside of a browser enviourment untill the node.js was created. Running JS outside of browser could let you use the same web-UI language to build up the backend server, deal with database and create RESTful API.

## 2. What is the difference between a module and a package?

A JS module is normally a signle file, has limited features. While a package is a folder contains many modules and is a collection of different features.

## 3. What does the node package manager do?

This CLI tool find, install, update and uninstall Node packages.

## 4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

```javascript
// Exporting individual features
export let name1, name2, …, nameN; // also var, const
export let name1 = …, name2 = …, …, nameN; // also var, const
export function functionName(){...}
export class ClassName {...}

// Export list
export { name1, name2, …, nameN };

// Renaming exports
export { variable1 as name1, variable2 as name2, …, nameN };

// Exporting destructured assignments with renaming
export const { name1, name2: bar } = o;

// Default exports
export default expression;
export default function (…) { … } // also class, function*
export default function name1(…) { … } // also class, function*
export { name1 as default, … };

// Aggregating modules
export * from …; // does not set the default export
export * as name1 from …; // Draft ECMAScript® 2O21
export { name1, name2, …, nameN } from …;
export { import1 as name1, import2 as name2, …, nameN } from …;
export { default } from …;

```
