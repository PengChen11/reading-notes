# Class-32 Reading - Custom Hooks

[Table of Contents](../README.md)  

## Reading, Research, and Discussion

### `1. What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?`

- Each React component has a lifecycle that goes through three phases:
  - Mounting
  - Updating
  - Unmounting

These phases can be monitered and the component can be manipulated depending on the phase that it is in.

### `2. Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect?`

- useCallback() allows you to prevent the re-creation of a function while using useEffect (which can be problematic - especially if the function that would be re-created sets off an infinite loop of re-renders)  

### `3. Why are functional components preferred over class components?`

- Functional components with the addition of Hooks are able to do the same work that class components are typically responsible for (state, react life cycles, etc) but in a way that is easier to maintain and test, and faster.

### `4. What is wrong with the following code?`

```js
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```

- useEffect should be on gloable level, not called in a loop.

## Vocabulary Terms  

- `state hook` :
  - def: This is a `useState` hook. It does not merge the old state with the new between re-rendering.
    - Resource: [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)  
- `effect hook` :
  - def: this is a `useEffect` hook. It allows you to perform side effects inside function components.
    - Resource: [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)  
- `reducer hook` :
  - def:
    - Resource: [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)
