# Readings: HTTP and REST

- The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless request-response application layer protocol.

- HTTP is often associated with serving .html files but is also used to transfer images, videos, .json, .xml, binary executables, and much more.

- A HTTP/1.1 request is formatted in text and transferred using TCP. The first line of the request contains the METHOD, URL, and HTTP VERSION.

- A HTTP/1.1 response is also formatted in text and transferred using TCP. The first line of the response contains the HTTP VERSION, STATUS CODE, and STATUS MESSAGE.

- REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. In layman’s terms, is a means by which we can reference, manipulate, and transfer state. Rest uses a common set of methods `(called “verbs”)` to operate on the state of a resource `(“noun”)`, generally using HTTP as the transfer protocol.

- A “RESTful Endpoint” is a URI that identifies the resource. When addressed with a proper method, you are able to effect state. In normal terms, this means “Performing CRUD operations over HTTP”.

|REST Method|CRUD Operation|Function|
|---|---|---|
|GET|READ|Retrieve 1 or More Records|
|POST|CREATE|Create a new record|
|PUT|UPDATE|Update a record through replacement `(Put it back)`|
|PATCH|UPDATE|Update a record `(just the parts that changed)`|
|DESTROY|DELETE\Remove a record|
