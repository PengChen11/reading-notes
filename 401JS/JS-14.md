# Reading: Access Control (ACL)

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

   - Basic auth is done when user initially logged into the website.
   - Bearer auth is done when user need to traverse inside the web application. Bearer auth is done by providing the user a token to user every time when travelling inside the app.

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
  
   - JWT user a secret key to do a hashing encrpytion for the date being provided.
   - It returns a long string that not readable (encrpyed) and could be decrpyed by a matching secret key.

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

   - Should be complex, long, and meaning less.
   - should never be saved in production code.
