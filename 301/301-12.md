# EJS PARTIALS
Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

if you want the same navigation bar and footer appear in all your web pages, partials will do the job!!

Let's start by create the partials files. Under the views/partials/ directory create a file called navbar.ejs which will contain only the HTML for the navigation bar at the top of the home and post pages:
```
<nav>
  your nav HTML here
</nav>
```

and a file called footer.ejs in that same directory:

```
<footer>
  your footer HTML here
</footer>
```

Now that we have our partials defined, we can use them in our home.ejs and post.ejs templates! In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by ```<% %>``` delimiters (you could change these delimiters if you really wanted to).

Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use ```<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> ```where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
Note: The``` <%- %>``` tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…
