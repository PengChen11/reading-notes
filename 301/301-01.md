# Responsive Web Design
With the growth in mobile Internet usage comes the question of how to build websites suitable for all users. The industry response to this question has become responsive web design, also known as RWD.

## Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites. Which term is used specifically doesn’t make a huge difference.

Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. While this does occasionally have its place, it normally isn’t a great idea. Mobile websites can be extremely light but they do come with the dependencies of a new code base and browser sniffing, all of which can become an obstacle for both developers and users.

## Flexible Layouts

 flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width.

**Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fixed measurement units, such as pixels or inches.**

Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

The formula is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it’s parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element.


**target ÷ context = result**

example:

```
section,
aside {
  margin: 1.858736059%; /*  10px ÷ 538px = .018587361 */
}
section {
  float: left;
  width: 63.197026%;    /* 340px ÷ 538px = .63197026 */   
}
aside {
  float: right;
  width: 29.3680297%;  /* 158px ÷ 538px = .293680297 */
}
```
## Media Queries

Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example.
