## Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
## Grid Elements
A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.
```
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">6</div>
  <div class="grid-item">7</div>
  <div class="grid-item">8</div>
  <div class="grid-item">9</div>
</div>
```

## Display Property
An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.
```
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}
```

### Grid Columns
The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.
### Grid Rows
The horizontal lines of grid items are called rows.
### Grid Gaps
The spaces between each column/row are called gaps.

You can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:
```
grid-column-gap
grid-row-gap
grid-gap
```
### Grid Lines
The lines between columns are called column lines.

The lines between rows are called row lines.
