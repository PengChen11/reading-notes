# Update/Delete

Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form.

## Client/server architecture
---
 The web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

 An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.


 ---
 ## On the client side: defining how to send the data
 ---
 The ```<form> ```element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.

 ### The action attribute
The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.

When specified with no attributes, as below, the ```<form>``` data is sent to the same page that the form is present on.

### The method attribute
The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method
- The GET method
  - The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

Consider the following form:
```
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```
Since the GET method has been used, you'll see the URL www.foo.com/?say=Hi&to=Mom appear in the browser address bar when you submit the form.

The data is appended to the URL as a series of name/value pairs. After the URL web address has ended, we include a question mark (?) followed by the name/value pairs, each one separated by an ampersand (&). In this case we are passing two pieces of data to the server:

- say, which has a value of Hi
- to, which has a value of Mom

## The POST method
The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

Let's look at an example — this is the same form we looked at in the GET section above, but with the method attribute set to POST.

When the form is submitted using the POST method, you get no data appended to the URL, and the HTTP request looks like so, with the data included in the request body instead.
