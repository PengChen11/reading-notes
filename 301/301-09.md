# What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

## 1.Pure functions
Here is a very strict definition of purity:
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
  - It should NOT uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.
  - It should NOT reads external files
  - Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.

- It does not cause any observable side effects. Examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
