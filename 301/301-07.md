# SQL
## What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

## SELECT queries
To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.

**Select query for a specific columns**
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```

## Queries with constraints
if you had a table with a hundred million rows of data, reading through all the rows would be inefficient and perhaps even impossible.

In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

**Select query with constraints**
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
```

|Operator	|Condition	|Example|
|--|--|--|
|=	|Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	|col_name = "abc"|
|!= or <>	|Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	|col_name != "abcd"|
|LIKE	|Case insensitive exact string comparison	|col_name LIKE "ABC"|
|NOT LIKE	|Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	|col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"|
|%	|Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	|col_name LIKE "%AT%"(matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS")|
|_	|Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	|col_name LIKE "AN_"(matches "AND", but not "AN")|
|IN (…)	|String exists in a list	|col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")|
|NOT IN (…)	|String does not exist in a list	|col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")|
