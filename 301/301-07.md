# SQL
## What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

## SELECT queries
To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.

**Select query for a specific columns**
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```

## Queries with constraints
if you had a table with a hundred million rows of data, reading through all the rows would be inefficient and perhaps even impossible.

In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

**Select query with constraints**
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
```

|Operator	|Condition	|Example|
|--|--|--|
|=	|Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	|col_name = "abc"|
|!= or <>	|Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	|col_name != "abcd"|
|LIKE	|Case insensitive exact string comparison	|col_name LIKE "ABC"|
|NOT LIKE	|Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	|col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"|
|%	|Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	|col_name LIKE "%AT%"(matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS")|
|_	|Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	|col_name LIKE "AN_"(matches "AND", but not "AN")|
|IN (…)	|String exists in a list	|col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")|
|NOT IN (…)	|String does not exist in a list	|col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")|

## Filtering and sorting Query results

Even though the data in a database may be unique, the results of any particular query may not be – take our Movies table for example, many different movies can be released the same year. In such cases, SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.

Select query with unique results
```
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s);
```

## Ordering results

Unlike our neatly ordered table in the last few lessons, most data in real databases are added in no particular column order. As a result, it can be difficult to read through and understand the results of a query as the size of a table increases to thousands or even millions rows.

To help with this, SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the ORDER BY clause.

Select query with ordered results
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
```

___
## Limiting results to a subset
Another clause which is commonly used with the ORDER BY clause are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, which are a useful optimization to indicate to the database the subset of the results you care about.
The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.

Select query with limited rows
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

##  Inserting rows
### What is a Schema?
 In SQL, the database schema is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.  
 For example, in our Movies table, the values in the Year column must be an Integer, and the values in the Title column must be a String.
 This fixed structure is what allows a database to be efficient, and consistent despite storing millions or even billions of rows.

 When inserting data into a database, we need to use an INSERT statement, which declares which table to write into, the columns of data that we are filling, and one or more rows of data to insert. In general, each row of data you insert should contain values for every corresponding column in the table. You can insert multiple rows at a time by just listing them sequentially.

 Insert statement with values for all columns
 ```
 INSERT INTO mytable
VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
       (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
       …;
```
In some cases, if you have incomplete data and the table contains columns that support default values, you can insert rows with only the columns of data you have by specifying them explicitly.  
Insert statement with specific columns
```
INSERT INTO mytable
(column, another_column, …)
VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
      (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
      …;
```
___
## Updating rows
a common task is to update existing data, which can be done using an  UPDATE statement. Similar to the INSERT statement, you have to specify exactly which table, columns, and rows to update. In addition, the data you are updating has to match the data type of the columns in the table schema.
Update statement with values
```
UPDATE mytable
SET column = value_or_expr, 
    other_column = another_value_or_expr, 
    …
WHERE condition;
```
The statement works by taking multiple column/value pairs, and applying those changes to each and every row that satisfies the constraint in the WHERE clause.

___
## Deleting rows

When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a DELETE statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the WHERE clause.
Delete statement with condition
```
DELETE FROM mytable
WHERE condition;
```
If you decide to leave out the WHERE constraint, then all rows are removed, which is a quick and easy way to clear out a table completely (if intentional).

## Creating tables
When you have new entities and relationships to store in your database, you can create a new database table using the CREATE TABLE statement.

Create table statement w/ optional table constraint and default value
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (
    column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    another_column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    …
);
```
The structure of the new table is defined by its table schema, which defines a series of columns. Each column has a name, the type of data allowed in that column, an optional table constraint on values being inserted, and an optional default value.

### Table data types
Different databases support different data types, but the common types support numeric, string, and other miscellaneous things like dates, booleans, or even binary data. Here are some examples that you might use in real code.
|Data type	|Description|
|--|--|
|INTEGER, BOOLEAN	|The integer datatypes can store whole integer values like the count of a number or an age. In some implementations, the boolean value is just represented as an integer value of just 0 or 1.|
|FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL	|The floating point datatypes can store more precise numerical data like measurements or fractional values. Different types can be used depending on the floating point precision required for that value.|
|CHARACTER(num_chars), VARCHAR(num_chars), TEXT	|The text based datatypes can store strings and text in all sorts of locales. The distinction between the various types generally amount to underlaying efficiency of the database when working with these columns.    Both the CHARACTER and VARCHAR (variable character) types are specified with the max number of characters that they can store (longer values may be truncated), so can be more efficient to store and query with big tables.|
|DATE, DATETIME	|SQL can also store date and time stamps to keep track of time series and event data. They can be tricky to work with especially when manipulating data across timezones.|
|BLOB	|Finally, SQL can store binary data in blobs right in the database. These values are often opaque to the database, so you usually have to store them with the right metadata to requery them.|

### Table constraints
Each column can have additional table constraints on it which limit what values can be inserted into that column. 

|Constraint	|Description|
|--|--|
|PRIMARY KEY	|This means that the values in this column are unique, and each value can be used to identify a single row in this table.|
|AUTOINCREMENT	|For integer values, this means that the value is automatically filled in and incremented with each row insertion. Not supported in all databases.|
|UNIQUE	|This means that the values in this column have to be unique, so you can't insert another row with the same value in this column as another row in the table. Differs from the `PRIMARY KEY` in that it doesn't have to be a key for a row in the table.|
|NOT NULL	|This means that the inserted value can not be `NULL`.|
|CHECK (expression)	|This allows you to run a more complex expression to test whether the values inserted are valid. For example, you can check that values are positive, or greater than a specific size, or start with a certain prefix, etc.|
|FOREIGN KEY	|This is a consistency check which ensures that each value in this column corresponds to another value in a column in another table. For example, if there are two tables, one listing all Employees by ID, and another listing their payroll information, the `FOREIGN KEY` can ensure that every row in the payroll table corresponds to a valid employee in the master Employee list.

## Altering tables
As your data changes over time, SQL provides a way for you to update your corresponding tables and database schemas by using the ALTER TABLE statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.

### Adding columns
The syntax for adding a new column is similar to the syntax when creating new rows in the CREATE TABLE statement. You need to specify the data type of the column along with any potential table constraints and default values to be applied to both existing and new rows.
Altering table to add new column(s)
```
ALTER TABLE mytable
ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint 
    DEFAULT default_value;
```

Removing columns
```
ALTER TABLE mytable
DROP column_to_be_deleted;
```
Renaming the table
```
ALTER TABLE mytable
RENAME TO new_table_name;
```
___
## Dropping tables
In some rare cases, you may want to remove an entire table including all of its data and metadata, and to do so, you can use the DROP TABLE statement, which differs from the DELETE statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;
```

Like the CREATE TABLE statement, the database may throw an error if the specified table does not exist, and to suppress that error, you can use the IF EXISTS clause.
