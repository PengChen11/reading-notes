# Test-Driven Development in Django

Test-Driven Development philosophy:

- Don't write ay code until you have a failing test
- Write code to pass a test

## Functional test vs Unit tests

### Functional test

Deal with the way a user will interact with your project, also known as functionality

In short, it is:

- Things the user would know and care about
- like find a recipe

eg:

- if the user goes to the homepage of foodiejournals.com, they will see the carousel.
- If the user goes to the login page, they can login.
- a logged in user can post new recipe.

### Unit test

Ensure that small pieces of your project are working as they should

In short, it is:

- Things the user would never know about
- like to ensure recipe.description() is working properly

eg:

- the ability to render a specific view with a specific URL call.
- The ability to apply the correct authentication
- the ability to create Recipe object from the model

## Functional test

1. Tools:
   1. **Selenium** is a testing tool to launch a real browser to test your app
   2. **geckodriver** is the firefox driver between your browser and selenium
